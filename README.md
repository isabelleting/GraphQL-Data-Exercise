# GraphQL-Data-Exercise

## Description 

An exercise with MIT xPro writing queries and mutations with GraphQL for restaurant data. 

## How To Run

After running npm install, command node index.js or npm start to start the Express server. Navigate to localhost:5500/graphql to access the GraphQL playground.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

I would like to have the restaurant data in a database like Strapi or Mongo instead.
